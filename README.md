# Charged particle motion around magnetized black hole

There are only two long-range interactions in physics: gravity and electromagnetism. Studying motion of just one test charged
particle particle we explore dynamic of matter inside black hole magnetosphere (magnetic field around black hole, created by accretion disk). The relativistic test particle will experience various forces while moving around central object, but we will focus on the most relevant forces for electron/ion like particles, which are Lorentz force and radiation reaction force. Using Hamiltonian formalism and particle effective potential, the equations for charged particle motion can be easily explored.

In this repository I put some code for particle motion written in Wolfram Mathematica. Feel free to use and modify the code as much as you wish. For comments, suggestions and questions contact me at email: martin.kolos[at]fpf.slu.cz

Using one particle formalism we will explore the influence of magnetic field on different astrophysically relevant effects: circular orbit stability for particles from accretion disk, magnetic field influence on quasi-periodic oscillation observed in the stellar-mass black hole binaries and also magnetic Penrose process which allows charged particles to accelerate and escape with ultra-relativistic velocities...
