# Charged particle motion around a magnetized black hole

There are only two long-range interactions in physics: gravity and electromagnetism. Studying the motion of just one test charged particle, we explore dynamic of matter inside the black hole magnetosphere (magnetic field around the black hole, created by accretion disk?). The relativistic test particle will experience various forces around the central object. Still, we will focus on the most relevant forces for electron/proton/ion particles, which are the Lorentz force and radiation reaction force. Using Hamiltonian formalism and particle effective potential, the equations for charged particle motion can be easily explored.

In this repository, I put some code for particle motion written in Wolfram Mathematica. Feel free to use and modify the code as much as you wish. For comments, suggestions, and questions, contact me by email: martin.kolos[at]physics.slu.cz

- some presentations I had regarding the charged particle dynamic in black hole magnetosphere Kolos_CFT2019.pdf, RAGtime2022_Kolos.pdf (motion in parabolic magnetosphere), Yerevan 2023 Kolos.pdf (Radiative Penrose process).
 
Using one particle formalism, we will explore the influence of magnetic field on different astrophysically relevant effects: circular orbit stability for particles from the accretion disk, magnetic field influence on quasi-periodic oscillation observed in the stellar-mass black hole binaries, and also magnetic Penrose process, which allows charged particles to accelerate and escape with ultra-relativistic velocities...
